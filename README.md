# Team Generator
```
This team generator allows user to input their role at their company.  These roles are manager, engineer, and intern.  The manager role includes: name, ID, email address, and office number.  The engineer role includes: name, ID, email address, and github username.  The intern role includes: name, ID, email address, and University.  This application uses class contructors with inquirer to build a team that will be rendered to a simple HTML document.  Depending on the specific role chose, the input field will be slightly different.  This application also includes validations and if/else statements to ensure each input field is valid.
